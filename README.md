## Future Planning 
| Issue | Proposed Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Students can't quickly submit assessments from app | Inside of the app, have a submission option in the assignment section of a course this will allow students to submit assessments anywhere on the go |
| No way for student's to calculate their overall course grade progress | Students may benefit from a grade progress tracker within the apps grades section that allows the students to calculate their overall grade in a course |
| No integration with other Learning Tools | Integrate other learning tools such as note-taking apps, study planners, and flashcard apps could make it easier for students to organize their learning materials and study effectively |
| Students may need a way to communicate and collaborate with their assignment groups within the app | Integrate collaboration feature that allows students to create groups within the app, and communicate through file sharing or a group chat |
| Students have busy schedules with many other commitments such as extracurricular activities or work | Allow students to add to events to the schedule section in the app and integrate a section for their enrolled clubs  |
